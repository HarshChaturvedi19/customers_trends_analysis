**Key Goals:**
- Analyze revenue distribution across gender, age groups, locations, and customer segments
- Identify top-performing products, categories, and seasonal trends
- Evaluate the impact of discounts, promo codes, and subscriptions on customer spending
- Segment customers based on loyalty, purchase frequency, and RFM principles
- Create interactive Power BI dashboards for stakeholder-friendly insights
